During the demo, you are asked to show us the following scenarios (players controlled by human are only to be shown in the last optional scenario, do not take them in account for the 5 first ones, except if it is your only player for a kind): 

- Turn by turn on a small map (8 by 8 max) with self wrapping actions, your mandatory ghost against your mandatory pacman. 

- Simultaneous on a small map (8 by 8 max) with self wrapping actions, your mandatory ghost against your mandatory pacman 

- Turn by turn on a bigger map (more than 8 by 8) with self wrapping actions, 3 ghosts (from your owns, multiples times the same is you have less than 3 ghosts) against 3 pacmans (from your owns, multiples times the same is you have less than 3 pacmans)

- Simultaneous on a bigger map (more than 8 by 8) with self wrapping actions, 3 ghosts (from your owns, multiples times the same is you have less than 3 ghosts) against 3 pacmans (from your owns, multiples times the same is you have less than 3 pacmans)

- Turn by turn on a bigger map (more than 8 by 8) with self wrapping actions, all the ghost (s)you have created (max one instance each) with all the interop ghost you have tested with (max one instance each) against all the pacman(s) you have created (max one instance each) with all the interop pacman you have tested with (max one instance each). If you have too many players in this case, you can stop at 10 in total (drop the less interesting first, like the two given by me). 

- (Optionnal) you can show a 6th demo if there is still time, to show something interesting you have done like additional human player, new functionality,...

Each maps, for the mandatory scenarios should have between 2 and 4 spawns respectively for ghosts and pacmans, between 4 and 8 bonus points.
